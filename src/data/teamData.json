      "bio": "Hayley's background is mainly in academia, but after realizing that her work in renewable energy research wasn't having the environmental impact she hoped for, she made a big change and transitioned from academia to business. To quickly learn about the business world, she joined a strategy consulting firm, gaining experience with different companies for a year. At the same time, she founded an e-commerce distributor company, closing an impressive 30 deals a day from her very first day. After conducting thorough research on e-commerce and the Thai mark market, Hayley gathered 15 Thai interns to find the best thai team memebers. Now, with her team in place, she is focused on making the ROUND8 service successful, help connecting South Korea and Thailand across various business sectors. She plans to expand her business to ASEAN countries and aims to develop deeper connections between ASEAN countries and the Republic of Korea, benefiting both regions. Thanks to her ambition, she frequently has meetings with diverse sectors in ASEAN and Korea. However, her Challenge thesedays is putting a makeup before meetings and her team memebr always asked her to apply lipsticks at least.",
